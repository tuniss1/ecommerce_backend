It can tolerate part sun, poor soils, and occasional flooding up to 20 inches. The tall spikes of lavender-blue flowers last from summer through fall and attract many pollinators. They are held well above the water for a showy long season display.  This plant is resistant to browsing by deer and is tolerant of heat.",

It has vertical green stems with horizontal bands similar to bamboo, but they're skinnier and taller like ornamental grass. Similar to ferns, horsetail reproduces through spores rather than seeds, as well as underground rhizomes. Horsetail is such an aggressive spreader it would likely be considered invasive if it weren't native to North America (as well as Europe and Asia). This is an important consideration when planting horsetail anywhere outside of a pot. To prevent it from taking over your garden or other planted ground, it's advisable to use soil barriers or another form of containment.",

It is found in moist soils, including wet open woods, streambanks, swamps and marshy areas. It was introduced to Europe in the mid 1620s where it earned its common name, likely because the bright red flowers variously described as scarlet, crimson, or vermilion are the same color as the vestments worn by Roman Catholic cardinals.
